# Code of Conduct

## Introduction
We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for
contributing.  All participants in our team and communications are
expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in DSCI 310 Group 15 activities
is required to conform to the Code of Conduct.  This Code of Conduct applies to
all spaces managed by DSCI 310 Group 15 including, but not limited to
email communication and online forums such as GitHub and Discord.

The person who acts as the reviewer each week is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct.
All reports will be reviewed and will be kept confidential.

## The DSCI 310 Group 15 Code of Conduct
We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive
environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we
do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our team members or
that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate
discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not
limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social
origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information,
religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority,
property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and
experience level.

Everyone who participates in DSCI 310 Group 15 activities is required to conform to this
Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces managed by DSCI 310 Group 15 including,
but not limited to email communication and online forums such as GitHub and Discord.
The person who acts as the reviewer each week are expected to assist with the
enforcement of the Code of Conduct.

### Expected Behavior

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect
and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of
platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and
professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of
behaviours in all DSCI 310 Group 15 events and platforms:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants at any DSCI 310 Group 15 event/platform include:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
publication of private communication without consent

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to
comply immediately. This applies to any DSCI 310 Group 15 events and platforms, either
online or in-person. If a participant engages in behavior that violates this
code of conduct, the reviewers may warn the offender and or inform the DSCI
310 Instructor to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose
appropriate sanctions.

### Incident Reporting Guidelines

If someone violates the Code of Conduct during a DSCI 310 Group 15 event or in an online
space outside of organised events, each team member is responsible to report it to the
Instructor Daniel Chen.
